Hi boys. I'm Tina. Put it on a t-shirt, Jimmy Jr, I don't want to hear it. If we
see any mermaids, I'm gonna ask them where their merginas are. Ok then, see you
on our date! Everyone began to touch each other's butts. Crap attack? Don't have
one? I'm no hero. I just put my bra on one boob at a time. Hey Jimmy Jr. Did you
see those two squirrels fighting in the courtyard? Hi boys. I'm Tina. Suddenly,
Tina Belcher appeared in the doorway. She knew what she had to do. I'm a smart,
strong, sensual woman. READ_MORE

Give them ridiculous French accents. Give them ridiculous
French accents. Follow me fellas...Lets go somewhere where the sixteen of us can
be alone. I'm out of control.

I'm just not sure if I'll be any good on the grill with one free hand. Ugg, my
heart just pooped its pants. Explore the morgue? You're right. I'm a firestarter
and a jinx. I'm going to destroy this whole family. Please don't tell Mom and
Dad. If we see any mermaids, I'm gonna ask them where their merginas are. I
don't know. Eating lobster? It goes against everything we were taught to
believe. I need both ears to hold up my glasses. Buns...sen. Dr. Yap, once I was
into you, but after seeing you torture my father, I think we should just be
friends with dental benefits. A pants-off. For me? We can make this work. We can
work out a dating wheel, just like a chore wheel. Let's put the try in triangle.
If I were a hamburger you'd come and watch! Dr. Yap, once I was into you, but
after seeing you torture my father, I think we should just be friends with
dental benefits.

I'm no hero. I just put my bra on one boob at a time. I'm not spooked. What's
the next thing after spooked? I'm that. I'm torn. Dad raised me, but the shark
gets me. Not if you're a fish. Hey, you don't want to mess with my sister.
She'll wear down your self esteem over a period of years. Here's a bunch of
numbers. They may look random but they're my phone number. Suddenly, Tina
Belcher appeared in the doorway. She knew what she had to do. I know how the
shark thinks. It's confused. It doesn't know why we want to kill it. It just
wants to go home. Dear God, this is Tina from school. If I drunk text you and
you're asleep, don't text me in the morning…that ship has sailed. I thought I
saw a baby bump. Everyone touched each other's butts, and it was great.

There is one place I like to go. The boys' locker room. You can only see up to
their ankles. I've been using the toilet like an idiot. You had me at horses,
but then you lost me at corpses. Everyone began to touch each other's butts. Put
it on a t-shirt, Jimmy Jr, I don't want to hear it. Here's a bunch of numbers.
They may look random but they're my phone number. I can't tell where your back
ends and your butt begins. YOU GORGEOUS IDIOT! You had me at horses, but then
you lost me at corpses. I thought I saw a baby bump. Give them ridiculous French
accents. If I drunk text you and you're asleep, don't text me in the
morning…that ship has sailed. Yeah it's an acquired taste. That I just acquired.
Time for the charm bomb to explode.
